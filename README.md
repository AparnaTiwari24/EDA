#  Titanic Survival Analysis - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project based on a modified Titanic dataset. The objective is to uncover insights about passenger survival using statistical and visual methods.

---

##  Objective

To analyze the Titanic dataset using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) and extract meaningful insights about survival rates based on features like age, gender, class, and fare.

##  Files

- `Titanic_EDA.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with complete EDA
- `Titanic_EDA_Findings_Report.pdf` – A PDF summary of key insights and visual observations
- `train_and_test2.csv.xlsx` – The dataset used for analysis

---

## Libraries

- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
---

##  Key Insights

- Females had a higher survival rate than males.
- 1st class passengers were more likely to survive.
- Younger passengers had better chances of survival.
- Higher fares generally corresponded with higher survival probabilities.

---

##  Visualizations

- Histograms for Age and Fare
- Boxplots comparing Age/Fare vs Survival
- Countplots for Gender, Class, and Survival
- Heatmap showing correlations between variables
- Pairplot showing distribution and survival separation
